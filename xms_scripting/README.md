Project-Alcatraz (or more formely known as eXtensiveMedicalSystem -> XMS) is a medical modification for ArmA.
It is designed to not resolve around the developer (me) but around the end user (you).
You are able to implement new items, drugs, systems, ... easily via mostly configs and barely have to touch any SQF file!
Due to that, it is possible to simply pass the wiki (at this stage of the mod still to be developed :3) and anybody understanding ArmA configs should be able to develop for it :3

Alcatraz will translate everything you created in those config trees to SQF for maximum performance!
In case you miss any feature for the configs, you just have to create a lil "user story" (issue describing everything from your perspective) and i will implement it ASAP.

This project is supposed to replace my older projects XMedSys (Dropped due to too heavy implementation errors) and XMS2 (Dropped due to heavy dependency on myself ... :3)
